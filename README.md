## Hi there 👋

I am a **Strategic Systems Architect** specializing in **Operational Continuity** and **Infrastructure Ownership**.

Most teams rent their stability from expensive cloud providers. I help you own it.
I created the **[Production SaaS Starter Kit](https://github.com/moasq/production-saas-starter)** to demonstrate how to scale predictably without the "Serverless Tax."

### 💎 The Value of Ownership
I don't just "write code." I re-engineer systems to serve the business bottom line.

- 📉 **Capital Efficiency:** I transition platforms away from locked-in models (Vercel/Lambda) to robust, portable containers.
- 🛡️ **Risk Mitigation:** I re-architect fragile Monoliths into Type-Safe, Modular Go systems.
- ⚡ **Predictable Scale:** I design backends that handle traffic spikes without degraded performance.

---

### 🏗️ Engagement Models
I partner with teams on high-impact strategic initiatives.

- 🔭 **Architecture Re-Platforming:** Moving critical systems from Node/Python to high-concurrency Go.
- 🔍 **Infrastructure Audit:** Identifying security risks, cost leaks, and scalability bottlenecks.
- 💬 **Technical Advisory:** Oversight on architectural decisions to prevent future technical debt.
